# ApiRickAndMorty
I made a site using React, JavaScript, HTML and CSS, i used to the Rick and Morty api to catch the images of characters and names of the episodes
This is a project of Fabrica de Software of the university Unipe, I used the methods of the Library React-Router-Dom to can go to the next pages without a slowed loading, it was a very dificulty projec because i'm was study React and JavaScript for only two days, with this project i wanna grow up my habilites and to make more projects for anymore companys
